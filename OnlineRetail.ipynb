    "## 1. Dataset Selection and Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selected Dataset:** Online Retail\n",
    "**Source:** Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "The **Online Retail** dataset contains transactional data for a UK-based and registered non-store online retailer. The data spans transactions occurring between **01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011**. It contains approximately **541,909 rows** and **8 attributes**, including:\n",
    "* **InvoiceNo:** Invoice number (Nominal).\n",
    "* **StockCode:** Product/item code (Nominal).\n",
    "* **Description:** Product name (Nominal).\n",
    "* **Quantity:** The quantities of each product per transaction (Numeric).\n",
    "* **InvoiceDate:** Invoice Date and time (Numeric/Date).\n",
    "* **UnitPrice:** Unit price per product (Numeric).\n",
    "* **CustomerID:** Customer number (Nominal).\n",
    "* **Country:** Country name (Nominal).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for Selection\n",
    "This dataset was selected because it perfectly satisfies the project criteria outlined in the requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Size & Scale:** The dataset contains over 500,000 records and 8 attributes, exceeding the minimum requirement of **500+ records and 8-10 attributes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Data Cleaning Opportunities:** The dataset requires significant preprocessing, allowing for the demonstration of:\n",
    "    * **Handling Missing Values:** A significant portion of `CustomerID` data is missing and requires a removal/imputation strategy.\n",
    "    * **Noisy Data:** The dataset contains negative values for `Quantity` (returns) and `UnitPrice` (errors) that must be identified and addressed.\n",
    "    * **Inconsistent Data:** Duplicate entries exist that require removal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Suitability for Regression Modeling:**\n",
    "    * **Target Variables:** The numerical attributes (`Quantity`, `UnitPrice`) allow for predictive modeling of **Total Sales Revenue**.\n",
    "    * **Advanced Techniques:** The data properties (including outliers and multicollinearity) make it an excellent candidate for applying **Regularization methods like Ridge Regression** to prevent overfitting, as required by the project specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Suitability for Classification, Clustering & Pattern Mining:**\n",
    "    * **Classification:** Customer behavior can be labeled (e.g., \"High Spenders\" vs. \"Low Spenders\") to train classifiers like Decision Trees.\n",
    "    * **Clustering:** The data supports **RFM Analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), which is the industry standard for **K-Means clustering** to segment customer groups.\n",
    "    * **Association Rule Mining:** The transactional structure is specifically designed for **Market Basket Analysis** (using the Apriori algorithm) to discover which products are frequently purchased together."
